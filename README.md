# Java-Hospital-Patient-Report-Generator-JUnit-Testing

This project is created with an aim to provide services to the Medical Sector by
providing an application to Hospital Administrators so as to keep track of
patients along with their medical records in an Hospital and generate invoices of
each transaction.
The Medical Record Generation system has basic functionality to add a patient
along with diagnosis details, simultaneously providing ease of documentation in
terms of business perspective.
Also, development of a system emulator that is capable of functioning more
quickly, accurately and updates the records and enables administrators to view
medical records instantaneously.
This Medical Report generator can be equipped with a Patient Scheduler and
can be deployed in a real world situation.
For example, it could be implemented for the current COVID-19 situation,
where the Scheduler prioritizes on the basis of severity and the medical report
generator can provide documentation of diagnosis reports with minimum human
interaction, thereby adding value to the product.
